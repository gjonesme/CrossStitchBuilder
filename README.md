# Cross-Stitch Builder

A React app that allows you to convert pictures to cross-stitch patterns.

## Example photo:

<img alt="sunflower" src="https://github.com/gjonesme/CrossStitchBuilder/blob/main/assets/paul-green-5lRxNLHfZOY-unsplash.jpg" width="250px" />

## Current Status:

Working project under development...

Key features to complete:
- Ability to output file (e.g. pdf) with cross-stitch pattern symbols
- Support for additional, common cross-stitch floss/thread palettes
- Currently using a quantizer called [RgbQuant.js](https://github.com/leeoniya/RgbQuant.js) by leeoniya to handle main image filtering, may add others and/or create my own
- General refactor for clean-up
- Add tests
